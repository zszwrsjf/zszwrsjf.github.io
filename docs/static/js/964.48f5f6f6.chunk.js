I'm Zhang Song. I completed my undergraduate studies in Beijing and came to Japan for my master's degree. I graduated and working as a software engineer currently at Cookpad Inc.\n\n\n\n\x3c!-- # Research \n\nI am researching disentanglement-based text style transfer on different datasets, focusing particularly on short text advertisements on social media platforms and their relationships when posted on different platforms. I am attempting to extract relevant feature vectors associated with the platform they are posted on and use these vectors for text style transfer tasks. Through data analysis, I have discovered that there is a certain correlation between advertisements and the platforms they are posted on. For instance, when an advertisement is posted on LINE, there are certain features that can infer which platform been posted solely from the ad text, and we propose that the good compatibility will have from the combination of ad text and platform. Using disentanglement techniques, I extract these relevant vectors, manipulate them in various ways, and combine them with other text to generate new advertisements that share similar features with LINE. This allows the advertisements to increase their effectiveness by adopting the characteristics of LINE. --\x3e\n",renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
